Novigi is championing blockchain adoption across industries starting with the Super industry. According to Novigi, there is a growing trend for interoperable and open data sharing between super funds and third parties which could be solved with interoperable DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology) solutions.

DLT, also known as blockchain technology, refers to the technological infrastructure allowing unalterable sharing of data while interoperability is the ability for dissimilar blockchain technologies to connect to each other. It is believed that the trend would also be accelerated by the incoming adoption by super funds of the Consumer Data Right system, following its integration into the banking sector.

The opt-in system would create a framework of data sharing between super funds, consumers and accredited data recipients.
